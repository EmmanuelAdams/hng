💡 Deadline: Saturday 5th Nov 2022 - 11:59PM WAT

💡💡 Bonus
We will send in a random string to the "operation_type" field . This string will be an operation written in words, for example “Can you please add the following numbers together - 13 and 25.”
This string will not be revealed ahead of time. On marking day, we will reveal the string and test it against all scripts.

Hint: GPT-3 could help.









MY CONCERNS
- check Enum

- After i run build, i used postman to GET, it returned values, i used postman to POST it returned values, but when I GET after the post is it not supposed to return an updated response?

- My validations for operation_type and result does not look strong enough to me, what if '-' or 'subtract' is inputted?

- Review

- How do I make my code more clean?

- How do I wrap my code for possible errors?
